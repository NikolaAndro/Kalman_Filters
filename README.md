# Kalman_Filters
Different examples for applying Kalman Filers using Python.

Kalman Filter folder contains multiple simple examples of Kalman Filter. Car position prediction (constant velocity or constant acceleration) examples were 
implemented using the formulas from Kalman Filter. Jetbot Kalman Filter folder contains code for predicting the position of a jet-bot in the lab while using 
camera to detect the jet-bot on the road and get its x and y coordinates as the input for measurements.

Extended Kalman Filtler folder is work in progress. ðŸ”­
